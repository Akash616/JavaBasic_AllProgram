This is Java's formatter syntax. You can find more about it here. In your case, you have 2 parameters, that get formatted.

First s1 which is formatted using %-15s. The % means that what follows is an argument that will be formatted. Then follows 
a - resulting in left alignment. 15 fills the string up to a length of 15 characters (adding spaces at the end). 
Finally the s means, that you are formatting a string.

Second x which is formatted using %03d. Here the 0 is the fill character, meaning that, if necessary, zeros are added. 
The 3 is again the width, meaning the fill character 0 is added as many times as necessary to make it 3 digits long (this time at the beginning). 
Finally d means, that a integer is formatted.


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("================================");
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            String s1 = scan.next();
            int x = scan.nextInt();
            System.out.format("%-15s%03d%n", s1, x);
        }
        scan.close();
        System.out.println("================================");
    }
}


output

System.out.format("The value of " + "the float variable is " +
     "%f, while the value of the " + "integer variable is %d, " +

Converters and Flags Used in TestFormat.java
___________________________________________________
Converter	Flag	         Explanation
d	                     A decimal integer.
f	 	             A float.
n	 	             A new line character appropriate to the platform running the application. You should always use %n, rather than \n.
tB	 	             A date & time conversion—locale-specific full name of month.
td, te	 	             A date & time conversion—2-digit day of month. td has leading zeroes as needed, te does not.
ty, tY	 	             A date & time conversion—ty = 2-digit year, tY = 4-digit year.
tl	 	             A date & time conversion—hour in 12-hour clock.
tM	                     A date & time conversion—minutes in 2 digits, with leading zeroes as necessary.
tp	 	             A date & time conversion—locale-specific am/pm (lower case).
tm	 	             A date & time conversion—months in 2 digits, with leading zeroes as necessary.
tD	 	             A date & time conversion—date as %tm%td%ty
 	        08	     Eight characters in width, with leading zeroes as necessary.
 	        +	     Includes sign, whether positive or negative.
 	        ,	     Includes locale-specific grouping characters.
 	        -	     Left-justified..
 	       .3	     Three places after decimal point.
 	       10.3	     Ten characters in width, right justified, with three places after decimal point.
